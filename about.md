## Summary
We are a journal club started in June 2020 by a bunch of computer science and computer science-adjacent undergraduates. Each week, one person is in "charge" of presenting a paper and prepares a ~10-min summary of the paper and interesting discussion questions.  Those not presenting in a particular week are encouraged to skim or read the paper.

In the past we've read papers/articles on data structures and algorithms, systems, algorithmic fairness and bias, theory, machine learning, and social issues in tech.  Our meetings and discussions are casual, and there is no obligation or expectation to attend.  While some background in computer science will help contextualize the papers, there is no required background and we strongly encourage younger/less experienced undergraduates to come. 

All are welcome to join; we've had students from many different universities, professionals, and even a professor join our meetings in the past!
